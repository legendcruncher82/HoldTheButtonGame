            <summary>What is DALL-E 2?</summary>
            <p>DALL-E 2 is a neural network model that can generate images from text. Basically, you type in a prompt like "a monkey riding a bike" and it will try its best to create an image of that. It is a successor to DALL-E, which was released in 2020.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Can I use this to make a bot?</summary>
            <p>Yes, though I don't necessarily recommend this because OpenAI already provides their own API that you can use for your own projects. So if this site stops working, then your bot will too.</p>
